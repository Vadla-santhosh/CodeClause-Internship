Unveiling the Iris: An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Summary:

I delved into the well-known Iris flower dataset to gain insights into its characteristics and uncover potential relationships between its features. This project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), a crucial step in understanding any dataset before diving into machine learning models.

Key Techniques:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured data quality by handling missing values (if any) and formatting the data for analysis.
Univariate Analysis: Analyzed the distribution of each feature (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width) using techniques like histograms and descriptive statistics.
Bivariate Analysis: Visualized relationships between pairs of features using scatter plots and correlation matrices to identify potential patterns.

Outcomes:

Gained a comprehensive understanding of the Iris dataset's structure and feature distribution.
Identified potential correlations between flower characteristics.
Prepared the data for further analysis, such as classification modeling.

Tools and Technologies:

Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib (or Seaborn)

This project demonstrates my ability to:

Work effectively with data using Python libraries.
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand a dataset's characteristics.

Prepare data for further machine learning tasks.
