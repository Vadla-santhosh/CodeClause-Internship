I'd be glad to provide a GitHub repository README that outlines projects on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Prediction:

Data Exploration and Prediction Projects

This repository offers two data science projects to hone your skills in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and prediction:

1. Iris Flower Classification: Unveiling Iris Dataset Secrets

Dataset: The classic Iris flower dataset, containing information on sepal and petal length/width for three Iris flower species.

Focus: EDA techniques to explore, visualize, and understand the data.

Key Steps:
- Import libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
- Load the Iris dataset.
- Conduct summary statistics to grasp data characteristics.
- Create informative visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, pairplots) to reveal patterns and relationships between features.
- Explore potential outliers or data imbalances.
- Interpret findings and draw insights about the Iris flower species.

2. Employee Attrition Prediction

Dataset: A sample dataset containing employee information (job satisfaction, salary, work-life balance, etc.) and a binary target variable indicating whether they left the company (attrition).

Problem Statement: Develop a model to predict employee attrition based on given features.

Focus: EDA and model building (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

Key Steps:

- Import libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, etc.).
- Load the employee attrition dataset.
- Perform EDA similar to the Iris project, focusing on employee features and their potential association with attrition.
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, categorical encoding if necessary).
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Build a classification model (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict employee attrition based on relevant features.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
