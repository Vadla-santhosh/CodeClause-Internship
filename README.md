Predicting Employee Attrition with Machine Learning

Project Summary:

In today's competitive job market, employee retention is critical for business success. This project aimed to tackle this challenge by building a machine learning model to predict employee attrition.

Key Activities:

Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Collected and prepared employee data, potentially including demographics, performance reviews, compensation details, and internal survey responses.
Feature Engineering: Created new features from existing data to enhance the model's predictive power.
Model Development and Evaluation: Trained various machine learning models to identify patterns in employee data indicative of potential flight risk. Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics.
Insights Generation: Analyzed the model's findings to understand factors influencing employee churn.

Outcomes:

Developed a machine learning model to predict employee attrition with a certain level of accuracy.
Gained valuable insights into the root causes of employee turnover within the organization.
Provided a foundation for building a targeted retention strategy.

Tools and Technologies:

Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow (or PyTorch)
Data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)

This project demonstrates my skills in:

Machine learning model development and evaluation.
Data analysis and feature engineering for predictive modeling.
Utilizing data science techniques to solve real-world business problems.

I'm eager to connect and discuss how data science can be leveraged to improve employee engagement and reduce turnover.
